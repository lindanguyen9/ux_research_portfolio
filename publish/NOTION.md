## Publish to Notion (2 minutes)

1) Open Notion → create a new page
2) Copy all content from `ux_research_portfolio/publish/notion_single_page.md`
3) Paste into Notion; headings and lists will format automatically
4) Set page icon/cover and toggle “Share → Publish to web” (or share with a specific audience)

Optional tweaks:
- Add a simple table of contents block at the top
- Create sub-pages if you want to split case studies later
