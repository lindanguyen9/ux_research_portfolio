# Linda Nguyen — UX Research Portfolio (Lead UXR)

Lead-level UXR specializing in product strategy, enterprise workflows, and growth experimentation. I align executives and cross-functional teams through mixed-methods evidence, clear decision narratives, and scalable research programs.

## Highlights
- Product strategy and enterprise workflows (verticalization, identity/data)
- Mixed methods with decision-focused narratives and governance
- Enablement and mentorship to scale research impact

## Case Study — Creating a More Verticalized Experience
### Executive Summary
- Problem: One-size-fits-all experience created friction for key segments; risk to activation and retention.
- Decisions: Focus investment and sequencing by segment; strengthen platform primitives and add role-ready templates/guardrails.
- Outcomes: Account-objects beta shipped; segmentation overhaul prioritized; governance cadence aligned decisions across divisions.

### Highlights
- Approach: Customer interviews across priority segments; internal SME interviews/surveys; desk research; product usage analysis.
- Leadership: Co-authored future-state narrative; established governance rhythm with Directors and Industry Leads.
- Tracking in progress: activation/time-to-value; beta adoption; error rates; retention by cohort.

## Case Study — Improving Identity and Data Management
### Executive Summary
- Problem: Duplicate profiles and unclear data meaning undermined trust and slowed orchestration.
- Decisions: Invest in identity resolution and in-product data understanding; phase role-based visualizations.
- Outcomes: Programmatic duplicate merge shipped; data pages enhanced with descriptions; tracking adoption/resolution speed.

### Highlights
- Approach: Multi-round interviews across AMER/EMEA/APAC and roles; surveys for prevalence and prioritization.
- Leadership: Partnered with Lead PM and Sr. Product Designer; facilitated decision reviews and sequencing.
- Tracking in progress: merge adoption; duplicate reduction; time-to-resolution; reliance on external dictionaries; QA cycle time.
