## Linda Nguyen â€” UX Research Portfolio (Lead UXR)

Welcome. This page consolidates my lead-level UX Research work with concise summaries and links.

### Highlights

- Mixed methods with decision-focused narratives and governance
- Enablement and mentorship to scale research impact

### Featured Case Studies
1. Creating a More Verticalized Experience  
   Summary: One-size-fits-all created friction for key segments; we aligned investment and sequencing by segment, strengthened platform primitives, and added role-ready templates.
