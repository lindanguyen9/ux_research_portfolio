## Story, Approach, Insights, Impact, Leadership

Company: Braze  
Dates: 2024–2025  
Role: IC / Research Lead  
Partners: Sr. Product Director, Sr. Staff Product Designer, Engineering Director, later Sr. Product Designer and Lead PM; indirect partners across Verticalized Solutions, Industry Leads, Product Marketing, Pricing/Strategy

## Executive Summary
- Problem: One-size-fits-all experience created friction for key segments; risk to activation and retention.
- Decisions: Focus investment and sequencing by segment; strengthen platform primitives and add role-ready templates/guardrails.
- Outcomes: Account-objects beta shipped; segmentation overhaul prioritized; governance cadence aligned decisions across divisions.

## The Story
As Braze expanded into increasingly diverse customer contexts, we saw a pattern: the needs of different industries were diverging faster than our one-size-fits-all product could keep up. Churn analysis and field conversations pointed to a common thread—teams wanted the power of our platform, but with less configuration burden, fewer workarounds, and more guidance that matched their operating realities. We set out to understand how a more verticalized experience could both improve customer outcomes and inform product strategy across divisions.

Our mandate was to clarify how much to invest in each of three priority verticals (anonymized as Vertical A, Vertical B, Vertical C), what problems mattered most, and how to sequence product bets. I led the research program framing, execution, and storytelling to guide roadmap decisions.

## Objectives
- Illuminate the highest-impact customer problems by vertical and quantify decision criteria for investment and sequencing.
- De-risk roadmap proposals by connecting needs to existing product capabilities and gaps.
- Reduce churn risk by identifying friction that disproportionately affects each vertical and opportunities to shorten time-to-value.

## Approach
- In-depth customer interviews across the three priority verticals to surface domain-specific jobs, constraints, and workflows.
- Internal SME interviews and surveys (Sales, CS, Solutions, Industry Leads) to triangulate patterns seen in the field and understand go-to-market implications.
- Desk research on industry patterns and competitor positioning to contextualize opportunity size and table-stakes expectations.
- Product usage analysis to correlate observed needs with feature adoption, configuration patterns, and support tickets.

Why this mix: We needed rich domain understanding (qual) paired with pattern validation and sizing (internal pulse + product data) to build a credible strategy narrative that would hold up in prioritization and resourcing conversations.

## What We Learned (Selected Insights)
1) Vertical A expects native support for entity relationships out of the box  
   Evidence: Repeated workarounds and schema gymnastics were required to represent complex account-person hierarchies; support tickets clustered around these patterns.

2) Vertical B’s non-technical operators need more guardrails in audience building  
   Evidence: Usability sessions and CS feedback showed error-prone segmentation flows; time-to-first-accurate-segment was high, and users leaned on power users to validate logic.

3) Vertical C prioritizes speed-to-orchestration over deep customization  
   Evidence: Field interviews emphasized pre-configured templates and best-practice flows; customers adopted quick-start patterns faster when provided opinionated defaults.

4) Platform-wide, customers want guidance that reflects their operating model  
   Evidence: Interviews and internal win/loss notes highlighted that prescriptive patterns (examples, templates, governance) unlocked activation and reduced configuration debt.

## What Changed Because of the Research
- Shipped: Account-objects beta to better support multi-entity relationships critical for Vertical A scenarios.
- Roadmap Influence: Audience segmentation overhaul prioritized to meet the needs of non-technical operators identified in Vertical B.
- Sequencing: Proposed a two-track strategy—(a) invest in core data model primitives with cross-vertical leverage; (b) layer opinionated templates and guardrails by vertical to accelerate adoption without fragmenting the platform.

## Impact (Early Signals; Tracking In Progress)
- Product: Clear problem framing aligned three divisions on shared primitives (data model, segmentation) while enabling verticalized accelerators.
- Users: Reduced reliance on workarounds in early beta for account objects; clearer segmentation workflows under active redesign to reduce setup errors and review cycles.
- Organization: Created a cross-functional cadence (Product, Design, Eng, GTM) around verticalized insights, informing PM roadmaps and enablement plans.

Tracking in progress with instrumentation and analyses underway. Metrics being monitored:
- Activation and time-to-value for targeted vertical cohorts
- Adoption of account-objects beta and migration off legacy workarounds
- Segmentation error rate and review-cycle duration for non-technical operators
- Retention/churn by vertical cohort post-verticalized improvements

Targets are being finalized with PM/DS; results will be appended once datasets stabilize across cohorts and time windows.

## Leadership Actions
- Co-authored a future-state narrative for Vertical A scenarios with the Sr. Staff Product Designer, grounding decisions in evidence and proposing a phased adoption plan.
- Partnered with PMs for the other verticals to translate insights into prioritized next steps and additional research, ensuring teams owned clear problem statements and decision criteria.
- Navigated stakeholder alignment with Director-level sponsors and Industry Leads; established a governance rhythm to review insights, risks, and adoption metrics.

## Methods & Collaboration Details
- Methods: 1:1 customer interviews (by vertical), internal SME interviews + survey, desk research, product usage data review.
- Sample/Participants: Priority verticals represent >50% of our customer base; participants spanned roles (marketing, data, engineering), seniority (e.g., CRM marketer, CRM lead, marketing operations), and regions (Americas, EMEA, APAC).
- Partners: PM, Design, Data/Analytics, Engineering; extended partners in Product Marketing and Pricing/Strategy for positioning and packaging implications.
- Constraints: Compliance and data privacy requirements in Vertical B; stakeholder buy-in required at Director+ level for Vertical A access and resourcing.

## What’s Next
- Expand the account-objects beta, define success metrics, and capture migration needs for legacy configurations.  
- Ship opinionated templates and governance guardrails for audience building; instrument to track error rates and review-cycle time.  
- Continue industry scanning to identify where vertical needs diverge further and to ensure our accelerators remain differentiated.
