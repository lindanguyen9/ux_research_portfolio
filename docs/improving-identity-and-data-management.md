# Improving Identity and Data Management — Product Strategy + Growth Case Study

## Executive Summary
- Problem: Duplicate profiles and unclear data meaning undermined trust and slowed orchestration.
- Decisions: Invest in identity resolution and in-product data understanding
- Outcomes: Programmatic duplicate merge shipped, data pages enhanced with descriptions, tracking adoption and resolution speed, reduced support tickets

Company: Braze

Role: IC/ Research Lead

### The Story
Identity and data quality sit at the core of lifecycle marketing. As our customers scaled, cracks appeared: duplicate user profiles obscured who the user truly was, teams lacked shared understanding of what data existed and how it should be used, and operators needed clarity fast to orchestrate campaigns with confidence. I led a multi-round research effort to map the real problems, align on decisions, and guide near-term product improvements alongside longer-term strategy.

### Objectives
- Identify the most consequential problems customers face in identity and data management.
- Inform product strategy and near-term UX changes to reduce ambiguity and friction.
- Improve confidence and speed for both technical and non-technical operators.

### Approach
- Several rounds of in-depth 1:1 interviews across regions (AMER, EMEA, APAC) and roles (non-technical/technical marketers, marketing operations, engineers, product) to surface pain points, mental models, and desired outcomes.
- Surveys to validate prevalence and prioritize issues across a broader customer base.
- Ongoing collaboration with PM and Design to turn insights into decision-ready proposals and phased delivery.

### What We Learned (Selected Insights)
1) Duplicate profiles undermine trust and downstream orchestration  
   Evidence: Teams struggled to resolve identity conflicts, leading to inconsistent targeting and reporting.

2) The current data structure did not allow customers to map more complex user hierarchies 
   Evidence: Customers struggled with problems such as having multiple email addresses for one user or associating users with accounts

3) Lack of an in-product data dictionary slows work and creates additional manual work
   Evidence: Many customers maintained external data dictionaries to understand fields and meanings, causing drift and errors.

### What Changed Because of the Research
- Shipped: A programmatic and in-platform duplicate-user merging capability to directly address identity fragmentation.
- Shipped: Enhancements to data pages, enabling field descriptions to improve shared understanding and reduce reliance on external docs.
- Roadmap: Prioritized features for both identity management and data management that would help marketers with their day-to-day workflows in Braze

### Impact (Early Signals; Tracking In Progress)
- Product: Identity resolution moved from ad-hoc workarounds to supported workflows; data comprehension improved with in-product descriptions.
- Users: Early qualitative feedback from customers to their GTM partners is positive; broader adoption observed across the customer base.
- Organization: Clearer alignment between PM/Design/Eng on identity and data primitives and near-term UX wins.

Tracking in progress: instrumentation for adoption of merge capabilities, reduction in duplicate profile prevalence, time-to-resolution for identity conflicts, reliance on external dictionaries, and campaign QA/review cycle time.

### Leadership Actions
- Partnered closely with the Lead PM and Sr. Product Designer to advocate for identity-first investments and co-authored a future roadmap framing short-term wins and long-term primitives.
- Facilitated decision reviews translating research into crisp tradeoffs (e.g., merge heuristics, guardrails, visibility) and sequenced bets balancing risk and value.

### Methods & Collaboration Details
- Methods: Multi-round 1:1 interviews, surveys; ongoing synthesis to inform iterative product decisions.
- Participants: Many customers across regions (AMER, EMEA, APAC) and roles (non-technical/technical marketers, marketing operations, engineers, product).
- Partners: PM, Design, Eng; GTM partners for qualitative feedback channels.
- Constraints: Typical enterprise constraints (access, data hygiene variability); confidentiality limits on sharing artifacts.

### What’s Next
- Expand measurement for identity-merge adoption and duplicate reduction; define success thresholds by cohort.
- Explore role-based visualizations for identity and profile relationships to match mental models across teams.
- Continue tightening in-product data understanding (dictionary governance, provenance, and change visibility).

### Confidentiality
Customer details and artifacts are not shared; summaries are sanitized.
