## Case Study — Growth & Experimentation (Template)

> Guidance: Show rigorous problem framing, experiment design, and ethical guardrails.

### 1) Context & Objective
- Funnel stage(s), target segment, and problem definition
- Success metrics (e.g., activation, retention, LTV) and guardrails (e.g., satisfaction)

### 2) Research & Experiment Strategy
- Rapid qual (concept tests, intercepts), survey sizing, log analysis
- Experiment roadmap: hypotheses → variants → metrics → decision rules

### 3) Execution
- Sampling strategy, bias mitigation, instrumentation
- Collaboration with Data Science and Eng for event quality and analysis

### 4) Results & Insights
- Wins and nulls; what not to ship and why
- Counter-metrics behavior and tradeoffs considered

### 5) Impact
- Metric movement (with CIs where appropriate) and business impact
- Learning debt paid and organizational changes (e.g., experimentation rituals)

### 6) Next Bets
- Follow-up experiments and product changes
